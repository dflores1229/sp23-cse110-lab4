1. At line 12 the code will print ```3```. The for-loop stops iterating when the value of the variable ```i``` equals the length of the array stored in the variable prices, which is of length 3. Since the variable ```i``` is of type var, it's value's scope is the entire function.
2. At line 13 the code will print ```150```. Since the variable ```discountedPrice``` is of type var, then its scope is the entire function. Therefore, in line 13 it outputs the last stored value (prices[2] * (1-0.5) <-> 300*0.5 <-> 150.
3. At line 14 the code will print ```150```. Since the variable ```finalPrice``` is of type var, then its scope is the entire function. Similarly as above, at line 14 ```finalPrice``` outputs the last stored value which is the same value as ```discountedPrice``` as explained in Question 2.
4. The function will return the array ```[50,100,150]```. This is because the for-loop iterates through the values of the ```prices``` array and applies a discount to each value. At each iteration, once the final price is calculated and stored in the variable ```finalPrice```, the value stored in ```finalPrice``` is pushed into the array stored in the variable ```discounted```. Since ```discounted``` is of type var, its scope is the entire function.
