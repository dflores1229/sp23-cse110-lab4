4. The code returns an error at line 13 because it is trying to access the variable 'result' which is only accessible inside the if-block.
5. The code returns an error at line 7 since it is attempting to change the value of a constant variable. As a result, line 9 will not print anything.
6. For the same reason as described in question 5, the code will return an error and line 13 will not be run.
